## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need to believe in astrology or tarot for it to work?**
A: Not at all. Approach with curiosity and openness, and see if the insights resonate with your experience.

**Q: Can you predict specific events?**
A: I focus on patterns, potentials, and timing of energies rather than specific predictions. The future is fluid and influenced by our choices.

**Q: How do I prepare for a reading?**
A: Come with specific questions or areas you'd like to explore. The more clarity you have about what you're seeking, the more focused the reading can be.

**Q: What if I don't know my exact birth time for Bazi?**
A: We can still work with your chart, though some timing information may be less precise. I can guide you on methods to rectify your birth time if needed.
